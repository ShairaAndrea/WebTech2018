		<p class="p2">Barangay City Camp Proper is one of the friendliest barangay in Baguio City headed by Honorable Aurora G. Abellera. The offials here are very hospitable and approachable. They make sure that every needs and requests of a citizen who, for an instance, is requesting for a barangay clearance, business permit and the like are going to be processed as soon as possible. That is how attentive they are when it comes to processing important matters. There is a time allotted for every transaction and the officials will see to it that these requests will be processed in the given period of time which is really convenient for those who requested such files. Unlike in other barangays it will take hours or even days before they could even get what they needed. Also, all the reports coming from the committee on Peace and Order, finance, women and children's welfare and the like will be collected and carefully reviewed. These reports were used as a guideline in creating decisions that will help the community for further advancement. They want their people to have confidence by making decisions transparent and in an accountable way.</p>
