		<h3>Decision Making</h3>

		<p class="p3">This is where they usually conduct formal meetings, setting their agenda, and the distribution of works. All the reports coming from the environment, peace and order and other committees are carefully reviewed and discussed that will help them in coming up with decisions, solutions and further improvements in addressing concerns and problems in their barangay. The officials are the representatives of their community and it is their responsibility to represent the interests of the community. During the decision-making process they will gather information, state their opinions and make final decisions. This is also a reminder to the officials that they have to be open because they are acting on behalf of their community.</p>
