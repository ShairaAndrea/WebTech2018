are subjected to community service in which they will help in clean-up drives, community <br/>
outreach for the people who are in need and more. They are also required to help the officials<br/>
with the rescue and medication of the victims whenever calamities strike.  They are required<br/>
to report weekly by showing up on the appointment set by the head of the barangay. The sole <br/>
purpose of this program is to track the drug personnels and at the same time, they can help<br/>
the community with their own little ways. It is a way of the barangay to divert the drug personnels<br/>
from doing drugs again.</p>
