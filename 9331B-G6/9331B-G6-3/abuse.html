	City Camp Proper Barangay dispatched several slogans and campaigns made by the students from a school nearby <br/>
	in order for the students to showcase their talents and at the same time be the voice of the youth in the campaign against<br/>
	the usage of illegal drugs. The slogans made by the students hopes that in their own little ways, they can help the community<br/>
	to be aware of the possible consequences of the drugs in their barangay. This also helps the students divert their attention from<br/>
	the things that may destroy them if they find their way in using drugs.

	City Camp Proper Barangay encourages the youth to participate in the campaign against drugs by inviting them to join<br/>
	some seminars headed by some agencies and departments in the Philippines. The PDEA discusses what will happen to one<br/>
	user or seller once they have been caught by the authority. The main goal of PDEA is to become an eye opener to the youths.<br/>
	They also invite the DOH to discuss the effects of drugs in their body once they've used it. They also discuss things on how <br/>
    to say "NO" to drug by giving them some tips. <br><br>

    As of now, there are no more cases of drugs listed in the barangay. Last October 2017, there was a bypass operation <br>
	made by Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency(PDEA). The case was, there were people who had a drug transaction<br> 
	in City Camp Proper, but later on found out that they were not residents of the barangay. Those who were caught were <br> 
	brought to station 5, and the elected barangay officials and other personalities (1 kagawad, 1 from media, 1 fiscal) were <br> 
	called to become witnesses to the inventory. For the surprise raids, the barangay officials do not perform it alone, they do<br>
	it with the Philippine National Police(PNP). There were no surprise raids concerning drugs held in the barangay. 
	However, <BR> one raid that was done involved a gambling case, but it happened in the nearby barangay<BR> not in
	City Camp Proper but still they are taking caution.

	The barangay offers continuous training programs under Barangay Anti Drug Abuse Council(BADAC) especially for the youth.<br> 
	They invite resource speakers from PDEA to talk about the possible effects of drugs to the human body. It has been effective,<br>
	and last November 2017,  there was a BADAC seminar held in BENECO. BADAC Members and all of the <br>officials involved in peace and order attended the training.
